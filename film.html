                <p>Josh is often meticulous with his works, using detailed documentation and forms in order to plan out and visualize his creative process such as using Final Draft in order to format his scripts and the inputting that format onto Google Docs to maintain his intense organizational methods. The times where he isn't on the computer writing and working on his scripts, he is instead thinking of new ideas and works that he can then input later to his scripts.</p>

                <p>Reed is passionate about storytelling and visual aesthetics, and he enjoys experimenting with different genres and styles to create unique and engaging films. This creative freedom not only allows him to explore his own artistic vision but to allow others in the production to do the same. Reed believes that collaboration is key to creating successful films, and he values the input and creativity of his team members. Although writing was at one point of his weakest skills, he has since improved and now enjoys the process of creating stories and characters.</p>
