                <p>Multimedia is an expansive creative field where you can explore graphic design, interactive design, animation, digital marketing, video production, audio production, and so many other options. Jamie and Layla are both multimedia creatives, but they have their own distinct specialities.</p>
                <p><b>Jamie</b> focuses on graphic design, specifically branding, and is currently using her combined design and marketing skill sets to work for the marketing department at CLU.</p>
                <p><b>Layla</b> is pursuing animation, and is an intern for Design 4st at CLU where she designs promotional materials for various school events.</p>

                <p>Jamie balances art with business by combining her graphic design skills with her marketing knowledge. She feels sometimes marketing can feel like it's all about capitalism, so the art side balances out her morals and allows her to do something she is passionate about. When it comes to her environment, Jamie can physically design anywhere as long as she has her laptop and headphones. Instagram also has become a big presence for her. Jamie uses her Instagram to take commissions, but also to train her design eye by following the work of other creatives. As she looks ahead, she considers various options. She could work for a non-profit to use her creative skills for a good cause, since that's what inspires her to keep creating. She could work in a creative agency that designs for clients for more diverse projects. Or she could join a company as an in-house designer and find creative solutions within the constraints of a branding style.</p>

                <p>Layla's childhood had a big influence on her creative pursuits today. Starting to draw in 6th grade, she now pursues animation, and growing up with cartoons has helped her understanding of color palettes and shapes. Even today, she practices her animation skills by redrawing those animations to train her understanding of motion and flow. Layla shares that a lot of her inspiration comes from the people around her, as well as music videos. In fact, when developing concepts and ideas, Layla likes to take a moment in time from a music video, and collect what people wore, how things looked, and books from that time into a complete moodboard to see the feelings they convey and what story this project will tell the audience. When it comes to her step-by-step creative process, Layla first finds a place with some peace and quiet, and good lighting, and with a solid playlist to listen to, she is ready to start working. She'll create a moodboard first, drop a couple thumbnails and drafts, and then give each separate element the focus. After that, she makes sure these elements mesh well together, develop them further, and finally get people to take a look to see if they articulate well.</p>

                    <h2>Tips</h2>
                    <h3>Tip 1</h3>
                    <p><q>Start small. Start making little graphic design things. It's easy to feel discouraged looking at all these people who have been doing it for years. But start small and build up to it.</q></p>

                    <h3>Tip 2</h3>
                    <p><q>Once you start (working on a project), do not stop. It called to you for a reason; do not question the reason. If it feels right, just keep on going.</q></p>
